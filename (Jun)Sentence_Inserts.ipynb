      "Among the most fascinating natural temperature-regulating behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants. These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature in their hives or mounds throughout the year. The constancy of these microclimates depends not just on the location and insulation of the habitat, but on the activity of the insects in the colony. When the surrounding temperature increases, the activity in the hive decreases, which decreases the amount of heat generated by insect metabolism. In fact, many animals decrease their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold, and people who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body temperature. This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia and hyperthermia.\n",

      "Once mammals reach adulthood, they have a very limited capacity for making new nerve cells—as they age, they lose nerve cells without replacing them. Birds, on the other hand, can generate new nerve cells in adulthood and this means they can increase the number of nerve cells in the brain when they are needed and decrease them when they are not needed. In Northern Hemisphere species that sing only in spring, the breeding season, the song nuclei are larger and have more nerve cells than during winter when they do not sing. They shrink in size when not needed and perhaps another area expands to take the place of the song nuclei. This time-sharing of brain capacity means a bird can keep the overall size and weight of its brain to a minimum.\n",

      "Stress responses in adult animals are profoundly affected by prenatal stress and variations in maternal care. The effects of variations in maternal care are transmitted across generations with offspring who experience high maternal care exhibiting lower stress responses and providing high maternal care themselves. Such effects would be adaptive when offspring experience an environment similar to their parents. Such results suggest that stress responsivity and maternal care are influenced by early experiences as well as genetic factors. Such regulation is seen in other mammals and even plants. Mothers providing low maternal care tend to have high-stress responsiveness, as do their offspring when they become adults. However, offspring cross-fostered to other mothers show patterns of stress responsivity more similar to that of their foster mothers. \n",

      "Some scholars recommend we focus on questions that are easy to answer. This criterion is not without logic: study of the fundamentally unknowable is futile and should be avoided. However, the larger danger lies in pointlessly “looking under the light” when the object sought lies in darkness but could with effort be found. Large parts of social science have already diverted their focus from the important to the easily observed, thereby drifting into trivia. Einstein’s general theory of relativity proved hard to test. So should he have restrained himself from devising it?. The structure of a scientific program is distorted when researchers shy from the logical next question because its answer will be hard to find. A better solution is to give bonus credit to scholars who take on the harder task of studying the less observable.\n",

      "While the transportation infrastructure may shape where we travel today, in the early eras of travel, it determined whether people could travel at all. The development and improvement of transportation was one of the most important factors in allowing modern tourism to develop on a large scale and become a regular part of the lives of billions of people around the world. Technological advances provided the basis for the explosive expansion of local, regional, and global transportation networks and made travel faster, easier, and cheaper. This not only created new tourist-generating and tourist-receiving regions but also prompted a host of other changes in the tourism infrastructure, such as accommodations. As a result, the availability of transportation infrastructure and services has been considered a fundamental precondition for tourism.\n",

      "The types of sounds, rhythms, and musical textures we find pleasing are generally extensions of previous positive experiences we’ve had with music in our lives. This is because hearing a song that you like is a lot like having any other pleasant sensory experience — eating chocolate, fresh-picked raspberries, smelling coffee in the morning, seeing a work of art or the peaceful face of someone you love who is sleeping. We take pleasure in the sensory experience, and find comfort in its familiarity and the safety that familiarity brings. I can look at a ripe raspberry, smell it, and anticipate that it will taste good and that the experience will be safe — I won’t get sick. If I’ve never seen a loganberry before, there are so many points in common with the raspberry that I can take the chance in eating it and anticipate that it will be safe.\n",

      "Every aspect of training for elite athletes has explicit goals. Everything they do inside and outside the practice venue is goal directed. As coach, you want to help your athletes do two things: be goal directed and set their own goals. When working with your athletes, give them daily, weekly, and monthly goals. You can write them down and give them to your athletes. For example, when I observed a practice in China, I noticed the coach would give each diver a piece of paper with that day’s individual practice and goals. Remember, don’t limit goals to just the physical practice. They should also have goals for other parts of training such as their warm-up routine, mental training, and conditioning. Also, have your athletes take their sport home with them. Encourage them to keep a journal in which they reflect on their practices and competition performances, set new practice goals, evaluate their short-term and long-term goals, and so on.\n",

      "With some songs, the communication of a dominant emotional mood or a specific rhythmic feel are just as important as the communication of the lyrics. Many blues songs are in this category. Despite the differences implied by genre and tradition, it is safe to say that the successful communication of a text is not always necessary for a successful singing performance, and it is never sufficient. Even in genres where it is expected that lyrics are understandable, such as opera and art song, there is more going on. Joan Sutherland, the Australian soprano, was sometimes criticized for poor diction because she changed some of her vowel sounds ever so slightly. Yet this shortcoming did not bar her from being considered one of the greatest opera singers of the twentieth century.\n",

      "Major long-term threats to deep-sea fishes, as with all life on the planet, derive from trends of global climate change. Although deep-sea fishes are generally coldwater species, warming of the oceans itself may not be a direct threat. Many of the deep-sea fishes originated during the early Cretaceous when the deep sea was warm, and the Mediterranean Sea, which is warm down to a depth of over 5,000 m, is populated by deep-sea fishes. On the other hand, substantial changes may be expected in ocean ecosystems over the next 100 years driven by an increase in dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and consequent ocean acidification resulting from burning of fossil fuels.Although the effects on deep-sea fishes are likely to be indirect through loss of coral habitats and changes in prey availability, larval stages of deep-sea fishes in the surface layers of the ocean may be directly affected by acidity.\n"

      "The key to any recycling programme is participation, which is greatly influenced by motivation. People can be motivated by extrinsic or intrinsic rewards. Usually, extrinsic rewards consist of a payment for collected materials. This solution can be very effective, but extrinsically motivated behaviour does not continue on its own when the inducement is withdrawn. On the other hand, intrinsic rewards fulfil a person’s need to have an impact on their world, providing satisfaction to individuals. For these reasons, intrinsic behaviour tends to last longer than extrinsically motivated behaviour. An extensive study in Sweden showed that the moral motives significantly lower the cost associated with households’ recycling efforts. Furthermore, moral motives can, in some cases, be the cause of inefficient policy outcomes when introducing economic incentives to promote recycling efforts. \n",

Little things like recycling your junk mail, installing energy-efficient lightbulbs, and reusing grocery bags, all make a difference, although a seemingly small one. But along with the small changes, making a better future is going to require huge ideas and huge actions. We need to think big, because we are going to have to take big steps as a society. As Rick Smalley put it: “We have to do more with less.”. We have to provide more food, more water, and more energy to more people, using not just less of Earth’s resources— not just less fossil fuel, but no fossil fuel at all. We need to break free of our carbon shackles. I’m sure that if we understand energy and how its production affects the atmosphere, we can do all that.\n",
