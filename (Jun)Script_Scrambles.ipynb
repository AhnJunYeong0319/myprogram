      "Studies show that no one is “born” to be an entrepreneur and that everyone has the potential to become one. Whether someone does or doesn’t is a function of environment, life experiences, and personal choices. However, there are personality traits and characteristics commonly associated with entrepreneurs. These traits are developed over time and evolve from an individual’s social context. For example, people with parents who were self-employed are more likely to become entrepreneurs.  After witnessing a father’s or mother’s independence in the workplace, an individual is more likely to find independence appealing. Similarly, people who personally know an entrepreneur are more than twice as likely to be involved in starting a new firm as those with no entrepreneur acquaintances or role models.\n",

      "Scientists today are able to accurately date fossils, the rock-bound remains of organisms from past geologic ages. When fossils are arranged along a timeline, scientists can see gradual changes from simple to more complex life forms. In some cases, evolution through various intermediate forms over millions of years can be detected and compared to the present state of an organism. For example, the earliest known species of horse lived some 60 million years ago and, according to the fossil record, was shorter than 20 inches (50 centimeters) high at the shoulders. Successive rock layers yield fossils of increasingly larger horse species, culminating in the horses of today. As size changed, so did other aspects of the horses’ anatomy: teeth became adapted to eating grass, the bones of the lower leg fused, and multiple toes evolved into a single toe surrounded by a hoof.\n",

      "Given the range of goals that can influence learning, it is not surprising that different models reflect different types and degrees of goal-based influence. Thagard and Millgram propose a broad distinction between learning which is explicitly goal-driven and that which is goal-relevant. Goal-relevant processing is not explicitly directed by the goals of the reasoner, but results in outcomes that are nevertheless useful with respect to those goals. Thus, in goal-relevant processing, the desired learning may occur as a side effect of normal task-related processing. For example, a reasoner may have an implicit orientation to maintain an accurate model of the world around it. Goal-driven learning, in contrast, is driven by explicit learning goals of the reasoner; those goals influence or even determine the content of what is learned. As the reasoner’s goals change, so does the learning that results.\n",

      "Health is a dynamic and complex state. It is a product of continuous interactions between an individual’s genetic makeup, environmental conditions, and personal experiences. For example, an infant’s immediate and long-term health is influenced by his or her mother’s personal lifestyle practices during pregnancy: her diet; use or avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and certain medications; routine prenatal care; and exposure to communicable illnesses or toxic stress. Mothers who fail to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to infants who are born prematurely, have low birth weight, or experience a range of special challenges. These children also face a significantly greater risk of developing chronic health problems and early death. In contrast, a child who is born healthy, raised in a nurturing family, consumes a nutritious diet, lives in a safe environment, and has numerous opportunities for learning and recreation is more likely to enjoy a healthy life.\n",

      "Urbanization has been taking place since the Neolithic Revolution, when agriculture enabled food surpluses to create a division of labor in settlements. The unlocking of human ingenuity to work on technology, trade, and urban culture has created ever-expanding opportunities in cities. However, while some cities took advantage of these new opportunities, many remained little more than rural trading posts. Urban opportunities accelerated with the Industrial Revolution and more recently with the globalization of the economy. But again, not every city has taken advantage of these opportunities. Some cities, such as Liverpool, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, have struggled to adapt to the new opportunities and have relied for too long on outmoded methods of industrial production.

Once used extensively by primitive tribes, it is still used today in some places, like Borneo. The process involves slashing the bark on the tree, which stops the sap from flowing and eventually kills the tree. The leaves die and fall off, allowing sunlight to filter onto the forest floor where the fallen leaves change into fertilizer. Then crops are planted. In two or three years, when the soil starts to show signs of being depleted of nutrients, the dead trees are burned, the ash provides fertilizer, and more crops are planted.

Those that have the best techniques for obtaining food are the ones most likely to grow and reproduce. Predation affects the size of prey populations and the diversity of species within a community. One reason nonnative species are often a serious problem is a lack of natural predators in their new homes. Purple loosestrife is such a species, whereas in its native habitats its populations are kept in check by a leaf-eating beetle and root-eating weevil. Parasitism is a variety of predation; a parasite feeds on prey but often weakens rather than kills its host. Some parasites, such as wheat rust, have very specific host requirements.

Later, children playfully rehearse more complex linguistic constructions, sometimes in monologue when alone. But of course, their language play is influenced by culture. Infants gradually restrict their babbling to the phonemes of their native language and, later, play with the words and grammatical constructions of that language. Children everywhere also engage in constructive play, thereby exercising the crucial human skill of building things, but what they build depends on what they see in the world around them.

In principle, any sound would have done, so the first coiner of a term for a political affiliation, for instance, could have used glorg or schmendrick or mcgillicuddy. But people are poor at recalling sounds out of the blue, and they probably wanted to ease their listeners’ understanding of the coinage rather than having to define it or illustrate it with examples. So they reached for a metaphor that reminded them of the idea and that they hoped would create a similar idea in the minds of their listeners, such as band or bond for a political affiliation. The metaphorical hint allowed the listeners to understand the meaning more quickly than if they had had to rely on context alone.\n",

Most of the children, who ranged in age from 4 to 8, chose to wait, but the strategies they used differed significantly. The 4-year-olds often chose to look at the marshmallows while waiting, a strategy that was not terribly effective. In contrast, 6- and 8-year-olds used language to help overcome temptation, although in different ways. The 6-year-olds spoke and sang to themselves, reminding themselves they would get more treats if they waited. The 8-year-olds focused on aspects of the marshmallows unrelated to taste, such as appearance, which helped them to wait. In short, children used “self-talk” to regulate their behavior.\n",

      "It is a false belief to think that you are either a big-picture thinker or a detailoriented person. You cannot be a big-picture thinker without knowing the supporting facts or else you would be an empty suit. The brainpower of zoom in requires attending to facts, content, and the situation at hand. Gathering facts and using them to support a novel approach is essential to enhancing integrated reasoning and deeper level thinking. However, it’s a delicate balance of knowing when to gather more information and knowing when to stop looking for more facts to develop a point of view. The key is to toggle back and forth from the immense raw details to form high-level ideas. It is not enough to understand all the facts; it is highly critical to fit them into a larger schema. \n",

      "Humans progress by building more and better tools. They want more tools to generate higher, and yet higher, standards of living. Economists as late as the early 1950s worried that the Great Depression would resume after World War II because of satiated wants. Having everything he or she could imagine, the consumer would want nothing else, tool-building would stop, and economic growth would dry up. But satiated wants are not part of human nature.  Unlike other animal species, we do not stop building when we are well fed, warm, and dry. Our imagination of what might be is always ahead of the reality.

      "Routines are beneficial because they allow us to get things done without much thought. For example, if every morning you had to relearn how to dress yourself or cook your breakfast, you’d never make it to work on time. Routines can be harmful, however, if they prevent us from developing a fresh perspective. They are most dangerous when we are least conscious of the extent to which our perception and cognition are guided by them. Sometimes our habits become so integral to our thinking that we fail to identify them as habits, and instead consider them “the way things are done.”. Thus, we need an occasional shock to shake us out of our mental patterns. I call this shock “a whack on the side of the head,” and it can stimulate us to ask the questions that lead us to new answers.\n",

      "Some city planning experts called for legislation against texting while walking that would be followed by a deep change of norms. This recommendation is based on the assumption that this change is welcomed, but laws banning texting while walking failed in Toronto, Arkansas, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Meanwhile, high-tech firms are developing technological solutions to the problem, offering a transparent screen that allows pedestrians to see what is going on in front of them while texting. Another direction for adaptation to the problem was provided by city councils via better urban planning and interventions to generate awareness. Some towns and college campuses have put ‘look up’ signs in dangerous stairwells and intersections. Hong Kong added announcements in its subway system recommending that passengers look around; New York City reduced speeds for cars, and San Francisco fosters pedestrian-only corridors.\n",

For example, many people start to dress like their boss, although they don’t realize it. Even more often, people unconsciously mirror their boss’s nonverbal behaviors during a meeting — using similar hand gestures or crossing the same leg, and so on. This is not crazy behavior. Indeed, there does appear to be an evolutionary advantage for those who mirror others. People who dress like their boss actually get paid more and promoted more quickly. When we mirror others, they like us more. Unfortunately, the downside is that we behave in a more conformist fashion.\n",

However, at some point, the thing you’re pursuing may no longer make sense, and you need to learn to jump off the dead horse. Stop banging your head against the wall, and let it go.

      "Once mammals reach adulthood, they have a very limited capacity for making new nerve cells—as they age, they lose nerve cells without replacing them. Birds, on the other hand, can generate new nerve cells in adulthood and this means they can increase the number of nerve cells in the brain when they are needed and decrease them when they are not needed. In Northern Hemisphere species that sing only in spring, the breeding season, the song nuclei are larger and have more nerve cells than during winter when they do not sing. They shrink in size when not needed and perhaps another area expands to take the place of the song nuclei. This time-sharing of brain capacity means a bird can keep the overall size and weight of its brain to a minimum.\n",

      "Stress responses in adult animals are profoundly affected by prenatal stress and variations in maternal care. The effects of variations in maternal care are transmitted across generations with offspring who experience high maternal care exhibiting lower stress responses and providing high maternal care themselves. Such effects would be adaptive when offspring experience an environment similar to their parents. Such results suggest that stress responsivity and maternal care are influenced by early experiences as well as genetic factors. Such regulation is seen in other mammals and even plants. Mothers providing low maternal care tend to have high-stress responsiveness, as do their offspring when they become adults. However, offspring cross-fostered to other mothers show patterns of stress responsivity more similar to that of their foster mothers. \n",

However, the larger danger lies in pointlessly “looking under the light” when the object sought lies in darkness but could with effort be found. Large parts of social science have already diverted their focus from the important to the easily observed, thereby drifting into trivia. Einstein’s general theory of relativity proved hard to test. So should he have restrained himself from devising it?. The structure of a scientific program is distorted when researchers shy from the logical next question because its answer will be hard to find. A better solution is to give bonus credit to scholars who take on the harder task of studying the less observable.\n"

We take pleasure in the sensory experience, and find comfort in its familiarity and the safety that familiarity brings. I can look at a ripe raspberry, smell it, and anticipate that it will taste good and that the experience will be safe — I won’t get sick.

Despite the differences implied by genre and tradition, it is safe to say that the successful communication of a text is not always necessary for a successful singing performance, and it is never sufficient. Even in genres where it is expected that lyrics are understandable, such as opera and art song, there is more going on. Joan Sutherland, the Australian soprano, was sometimes criticized for poor diction because she changed some of her vowel sounds ever so slightly. Yet this shortcoming did not bar her from being considered one of the greatest opera singers of the twentieth century.\n",

      "The key to any recycling programme is participation, which is greatly influenced by motivation. People can be motivated by extrinsic or intrinsic rewards. Usually, extrinsic rewards consist of a payment for collected materials. This solution can be very effective, but extrinsically motivated behaviour does not continue on its own when the inducement is withdrawn. On the other hand, intrinsic rewards fulfil a person’s need to have an impact on their world, providing satisfaction to individuals. For these reasons, intrinsic behaviour tends to last longer than extrinsically motivated behaviour. An extensive study in Sweden showed that the moral motives significantly lower the cost associated with households’ recycling efforts. Furthermore, moral motives can, in some cases, be the cause of inefficient policy outcomes when introducing economic incentives to promote recycling efforts. \n",

However, some energy drinks contain almost three times the caffeine of an average carbonated soda. Although the acute mood effects associated with consuming energy drinks are often positive, regular consumption of energy drinks is associated with undesirable mental health effects such as anxiety, depression, and possibly mood disorders. In one study based on 136 undergraduate students, the authors observed that male students in general consumed more energy drinks than female students. Moreover, students consumed energy drinks when they felt stressed out. However, consuming energy drinks on a regular basis was associated with lower academic performance. In another study based on 502 young males and 567 young females, the authors observed that energy drink consumption (100 mL/day) was significantly associated with anxiety (though not depression) in males but not in females.\n",
